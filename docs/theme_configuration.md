To make the R theme usable, you only need to perform basic configuration. You can also apply extensive customizations to the theme by referring to external resources.

## Basic Configuration

You configure the R theme mainly by modifying the `docusaurus.config.js` file.

1. Navigate to your site directory.
2. Open the `docusaurus.config.js` file.
3. Make appropriate edits.  
Each common option is `// commented` in the configuration file.  
**Example:** `title: "R", // The page title that displays in your web browser tab`
If you need more information, see [Docusaurus - docusaurus.config.js](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/docusaurus.config.js).  
4. Save the `docusaurus.config.js` file.

## Advanced Configuration
