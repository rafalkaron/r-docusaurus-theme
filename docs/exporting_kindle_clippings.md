## Before you begin

* Ensure that you highlighted some quotes while reading on your Kindle.
* Ensure that your Kindle is connected to your computer with a cable.  
    **Important:** Some third-party USB cables may prevent your computer from correctly discovering your Kindle.

## Procedure

1. Download the latest **Klipps** version for your operating system. See [Klipps Releases](https://github.com/rafalkaron/Klipps/releases).
2. Unzip **Klipps**.
3. Double-click the downloaded **Klipps** executable.  
**Result:** Klipps opens in a **Terminal** window and tries to automatically detect the clippings file on the connected Kindle device.
4. If a prompt appears, enter the clippings file path manually.
5. If needed, accept every security prompt. See [Accepting macOS Security Prompts](accepting_macos_security_prompts.md) or [Accepting Windows Security Prompts](accepting_windows_security_prompts.md).  
**Result:** Klipps exports the Kindle clippings file to an HTML file and saves the HTML file on your desktop.  
6. Close the **Klipps** window.

## Next Steps

* Safely eject your Kindle device from your computer.
